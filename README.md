## Skills
### Problem solving
* Something I have always enjoyed, I take pleasure in using logic to breakdown a problem.
* When working as an accountant finding breaks in reports, often required a calm logical ability to deduce the source of the problem.
* A skill I feel is very transferable to development particularly when methodically removing variables to isolate and find bugs.

### Communication
* A skill I have made a conscious effort to improve throughout my professional and personal life.
* I have experience coaching and training individuals to reach their fitness goals. This often involves listening to the client to hear what they identify as the problems and what they want to achieve. Then after considering their input together with my knowledge and experience provide a plan of attack which I would then coach and encourage them through with continuos feedback.
* The ability to find a solution for a client, based on the problem they have outlined I consider to have immense carry over into being developer.

### Aptitude for learning
* If something gets my curiosity I will normally have a strong desire to know more, and a keenness to understand and put into practice.
* Before coding this would cause me to have many varied interest from social/economical topics, fitness to world history.
* Upon embarking on my coding career I have found this tendency can be put to good use just within sphere of development. This ability leant its self very well to my time at Makers Academy where we took on a new topic each week.

## Education

## Interests
* Playing basketball has always been a passion. I have in past been selected to play for England.
* A more recent hobby was playing Magic: The Gathering, a game that requires tactics to both build and play with a deck.
* Plan to pickup salsa and golf this year.
