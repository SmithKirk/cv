# Kirk Smith

A curious and enthusiastic junior developer who recognises the rewards of following good development principles which were instilled in me from my time with *Makers Academy*.
Previously an accountant for a sovereign wealth fund manager but have now embarked on a major career change into the tech industry.

I am looking for a junior development opportunity that will allow me to work alongside a friendly supportive team where I continue my development and add value.

## Skills
### Software/web development
* Writing code with an understanding of OOP principles such as SOLID and DRY
* Using modern approaches such as TDD/BDD, pair programming and agile
* Main languages are Ruby and JavaScript
* Built apps with frameworks using Rails, AngularJS
* Testing with RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine, Karma, and Protractor
* Created UIs using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
* Experience using databases PostgreSQL and Firebase

### Problem solving
* Something I have always enjoyed, I take pleasure in using logic to breakdown a problem.
* When working as an accountant finding breaks in reports, often required a calm logical ability to deduce the source of the problem.
* A skill I feel is very transferable to development particularly when methodically removing variables to isolate and find bugs.

### Communication
* A skill I have made a conscious effort to improve throughout my professional and personal life.
* I have experience coaching and training individuals to reach their fitness goals. This often involves listening to the client to hear what they identify as the problems and what they want to achieve. Then after considering their input together with my knowledge and experience provide a plan of attack which I would then coach and encourage them through with continuos feedback.
* The ability to find a solution for a client, based on the problem they have outlined I consider to have immense carry over into being developer.

### Aptitude for learning
* If something gets my curiosity I will normally have a strong desire to know more, and a keenness to understand and put into practice.
* Before coding this would cause me to have many varied interest from social/economical topics, fitness to world history.
* Upon embarking on my coding career I have found this tendency can be put to good use just within sphere of development. This ability leant its self very well to my time at Makers Academy where we took on a new topic each week.

## Education
### Makers Academy (November 2015 - February 2016)
My decision to learn with Makers was a result of my bubbling curiosity in the tech industry and my desire to be able to create something from an idea with code.

* Taught best practice as a standard OOP, SOLID principles, refactoring, encapsulation
* Learnt to solve problems independently
* Pair programming everyday
* Lead standups from the beginning
